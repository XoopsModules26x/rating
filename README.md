Rating is an extension for XOOPS 2.6.0 that allows you to easily add a voting system to the inside of your modules. You can add as many modules as you want. For example, to rate a hotel, restaurant service, quality of food, price, etc.. 

It can be used by any module, it works the same way as the module Tag. It uses the jquery plugin 'jRating'.
